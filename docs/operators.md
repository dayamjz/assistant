# Operating the gate

This is a short guide for the person or agent that pushes work through the gate
and for whoever owns the repository's CI and merge settings. It describes what
this build does today. [`prd.html`](prd.html) is the specification, and where
this page and the code could disagree, the code and the PRD win.

## Push through the `assistant` remote

`assistant init` creates the repository's gate and adds a remote named
`assistant` to the working copy. Pushing a branch there is how a change is
handed over:

```sh
git push assistant BRANCH
```

The gate's admission hook decides whether the push may proceed, and its
notification hook starts a run for that branch and commit. A push that deletes
a branch, or carries anything that is not a branch, starts nothing. An ordinary
`git push` to your other remotes is untouched, so a branch that is never pushed
to `assistant` is never validated. Nothing here stops a person or agent from
pushing elsewhere; the gate is the inner check for work that is handed to it,
not a barrier around the repository. A forge-side branch protection rule is what
enforces that for everyone.

A run walks nine stages in a fixed order: intent, rebase, review, test,
document, lint, push, pull request, and checks. Each stage that cannot decide
holds for a person, and `assistant status` and `assistant doctor` say where a
run stands and what stops one.

## Keep your CI required

The gate is not your CI (PRD section 12 lists "Being your CI" as a permanent
non-goal). Keep the forge's required checks on the pull request as the shared
outer check. The last stage reads the checks registered on the pull request's
head. While checks are still running, or none are registered yet, the run waits
rather than holding: the stage re-reads the checks about once a minute and
reports what they settle on. `checks_timeout` (global-only, default `168h`)
bounds that wait, and when it elapses the run holds for you rather than ending.
The timeout starts when the stage first finds the checks unsettled, starts again
whenever your base branch advances on the upstream, and is kept across a service
restart, so resuming a run does not reset it. A check or base read that fails
outright stops the stage instead of waiting through it; running `assistant` on
the branch again resumes it into the same wait. A pass does not say the checks stayed green,
and it is not a merge decision.

A repository with no CI at all must say so by setting `no_ci` in its trusted
configuration. Without that declaration an empty list of checks is not treated
as a pass.

## Keep `commands.test` targeted

`commands.test` is empty by default. When you set it, the test stage runs that
one command against the run's isolated copy and passes if it exits zero. The
stage derives nothing, so the targeting is whatever the command does. Point it
at a check for the change, such as one package or one affected suite, and leave
the full suite to CI. With no command configured the stage holds for a person
rather than reporting a pass it did not establish.

The command executes shell, so it is read from the operator's own
configuration (`config.yaml` in the home) or from `assistant.json` on the
default branch, never from the branch under validation, unless the operator has
set `allow_pushed_commands`. That opt-out cannot be set from a pushed branch.

## Merge order and stacking

The gate opens or updates one pull request per branch and never merges it. This
build has no merge step: its outcome vocabulary has `passed` for a merged pull
request, but nothing in the build records a merge. Merge order, stacked pull
requests, and queueing belong to the forge or to merge-queue tooling you already
use, and the binary has no stack view. If you stack branches, each is pushed and
validated as its own run, and the pull request stage reports which base the run
validated against so a reviewer can see when that differs from where the pull
request merges.

## What a pass does not cover

Review reads your change before the test, lint, and checks stages run. When
one of those stages takes a fix round, the code that round changes reaches the
push without being reviewed again: the push stage asks only that the head
descends from a reviewed commit. The judge-path rule holds such a round only
when it touches a test, CI, or lint file, not when it changes other code. PRD
section 14 lists this as an open question (issue #63). Until it is settled,
read the commits the pipeline added after review before you merge.

## Hosted reviewers

Hosted review bots such as Copilot or CodeRabbit can comment on the pull request
the gate opens. They complement the gate and do not replace it. They run
outside the gate, so the properties the gate is built to hold do not extend to
them:

- P4: reviewing and fixing are separate roles, and a review never resumes the
  session that prescribed the fix it checks.
- P7: configuration that executes code is read from the default branch, never
  from the pushed commit.
- The judge-path rule: a fix round after review that touches a test, CI, or lint
  file holds for a person (`judge_paths`, PRD section 10).

Nothing in this build reads or answers those bots' comments, so treat them as
input for the human who reviews the pull request. The tests for P4, P7 and the
judge-path rule show the machinery behaves as specified, not that every review
is good; `internal/journey/README.md` says what a green run there establishes.
